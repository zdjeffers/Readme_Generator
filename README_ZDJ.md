# README File Generator
Utilizing Javascript and node.js to automatically generate readme.md files for each project.
### Introduction:
This is my attempt to procedurally generate a markdown file. This includes getting prompts from the user utilizing nodes.js. You have the ability to enter in your title, description, usage, contribution, tests that you may have run, applicable licenses, your github account, and you email. Once complete, it will automatically create an applicable markdown.md file utilizing the users inputs.


### Instructions:
You will need to utilize an IDE such as VSCode and install node.js. Once this is completed, you will need to install the package.json file and inquirer package. Once done, you can run the index.js file using node to generate the working document.
